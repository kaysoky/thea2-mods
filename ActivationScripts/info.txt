<SCRIPT>ActivationScripts.cs</SCRIPT>

This mod adds new Activation scripts to the base game but does not change any part of the game by itself.  Nothing in this mod will use the new scripts.

Activation scripts are used when activating subskills in combat and will modify game state, like the HP of characters on the battlefield.

These are the functions added:
