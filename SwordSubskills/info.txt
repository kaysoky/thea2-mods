Adds additional subskills for 1H and 2H swords, which trigger on playing the character to the front row.

[list]
  [*] 1H swords gain the Pommel Strike ability, which delays the closest enemy.
  [*] At the Elemental tier, swords will have the Defensive Stance ability, which causes the character to gain shields after being attacked.
  [*] At the Legendary tier, swords will have the Sword Wall ability, which grants all allies shields upon being played.
[/list]

[list]
  [*] 2H swords will also have the Pommel Strike ability, but with higher delay values and horizontal splash.
  [*] At the Elemental tier, swords will have the Warding Swings ability, which decreases the power of the closest enemy, plus horizontal splash.
  [*] At the Legendary tier, swords will have the Flowing Strikes ability, which drains power from hit enemies, and increases your own.
[/list]
