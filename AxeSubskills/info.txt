Adds additional subskills for 1H and 2H axes, which have a variety of triggers when the character is played to the front row.

[list]
  [*] 1H axes now grant a small gathering bonus.  Because they can chop trees and such.
  [*] At the Elemental tier, axes have the Rend Armor ability, which destroys shields (and only shields) of an attacked target, plus horizontal splash.
  [*] At the Legendary tier, axes have the Berserk ability, which increases a character's damage and speed upon getting hit.
[/list]

[list]
  [*] 2H axes will also have the small gathering bonus.
  [*] At the Elemental tier, axes have the Crippling Strike ability, which drastically lowers an enemy's damage after hitting them.
  [*] At the Legendary tier, axes have the TIMBER! ability, which strings an additional melee strike after a killing blow.  This ability has a high strength multiplier.  The killing blow can potentially trigger more killing blows.  (This needs verification.)
[/list]

This mod does not modify any existing subskills and will only be incompatible with mods that modify the procedural generation of axes (DATABASE_PROCEDURAL_ITEM_DATA.xml).
